#histogram.js

histogram.js is a pure JavaScript library that without any dependence. histogram.js is designed 
for images and high performance. histogram.js support modern browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, 
Safari, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 10+.

I am going to achieve following goals:

1. Design histogram data object
2. Create a function to read color data to histogram object from a image
3. Plot a multiple lines chart to represent colors (RGB) level occurred frequency
